# Financial Risk Scoring Model for Loan Approval

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a Financial Risk Scoring Model to predict loan default probability using customer financial and demographic data. The model helps financial institutions identify high-risk applicants and improve loan approval decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To predict whether a customer will default on a loan using machine learning techniques and risk modeling.
